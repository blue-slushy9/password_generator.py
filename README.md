This is a password generator I coded from scratch. It is designed to generate secure passwords, so it won't output anything lower than 30 characters. The user is able to choose what types of characters they want included: letters, upper and/or lower case; numbers from 0-9; and since supported symbols vary so much from site to site, the user is prompted to enter them manually.

I've debugged this code as much as I could, and tried to create error messages for all possible problems.
